        CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
        - Focus on SPECIFIC DISHES with the technique, NOT technique tutorials
        - Each query should find a COMPLETE RECIPE for a dish
        - Include dish names + technique + skill level

        For "pan sauces":

        - "balsamic pan sauce pork recipe" (tangy/vinegar)

        - "pan fried fish with lemon butter recipe beginner"
        - "japanese tonkatsu shallow frying recipe"

        BAD EXAMPLES (DO NOT USE):
