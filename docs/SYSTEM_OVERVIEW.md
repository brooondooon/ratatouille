# Ratatouille: AI Culinary Coach - System Overview

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** October 6, 2025
**Architecture Type:** Multi-Agent System with LangGraph Orchestration

---

## Executive Summary

Ratatouille is an intelligent recipe recommendation system that helps home cooks learn culinary techniques through personalized recipe suggestions. Unlike traditional recipe search engines that rely on keyword matching, Ratatouille uses a **5-agent multi-agent system** with **semantic understanding** to validate that recipes genuinely teach the requested cooking technique.

### Key Differentiators

1. **Technique Validation** - LLM-powered semantic filtering eliminates false positives (e.g., excludes "fried rice" when searching for "pan sauces")
2. **Educational Focus** - Recipes selected based on learning value, not just relevance
3. **Adaptive Coordination** - Agents observe each other's outputs and adjust strategy (retry logic when insufficient results)
4. **Nutrition Intelligence** - Automatic nutrition estimation for all recommended recipes
5. **Source Transparency** - Citations with publication dates and author attribution

## Agent Architecture

### Agent 1: Research Planner

**Responsibility:** Generate optimal search queries from user learning goals

**Input:**
```json
{
  "learning_goal": "pan sauces",
  "skill_level": "intermediate",
  "search_strategy": "initial" | "broadened"
}
```

**Process:**
1. Uses GPT-3.5-turbo to analyze learning goal
2. Generates 3-5 targeted search queries
3. Adapts based on `search_strategy` flag:
   - `initial`: Specific, focused queries
   - `broadened`: General terms + related techniques

**Output:**
```python
search_queries = [
  "pan sauce recipe intermediate serious eats",
  "how to make pan sauce technique",
  "best pan sauces 2024"
]
```

**LLM Cost:** ~300 input + 100 output tokens = $0.0003/request

---

### Agent 2: Recipe Hunter

**Responsibility:** Retrieve and parse recipes from web using Tavily API

**Input:**
```python
search_queries: List[str]  # From Research Planner
```

**Process:**
1. For each query (limit 3), call Tavily API:
   - `search_depth="advanced"`
   - `max_results=3` per query
   - `include_domains=["seriouseats.com"]` (MVP scope)
   - `days=730` (last 2 years)

2. Parse unstructured recipe HTML/text into structured JSON using LLM:
   ```python
   {
     "title": str,
     "difficulty": "beginner" | "intermediate" | "advanced",
     "techniques": List[str],
     "ingredients": List[str],
     "steps": List[str],
     "time_estimate": str
   }
   ```

3. Add Tavily metadata (URL, score, published_date)

**Output:**
```python
raw_recipes: List[Dict]  # 8-10 parsed recipes
```

**API Costs:**
- Tavily: 3 searches/request
- OpenAI: ~12,600 tokens (9 recipes × 1,400 tokens) = $0.0063/request

---

### Agent 3: Technique Validator

**Responsibility:** Filter recipes using semantic understanding of cooking techniques

**Critical Innovation:** This agent solves the false positive problem by validating that recipes genuinely teach the requested technique.

**Input:**
```python
raw_recipes: List[Dict]  # From Recipe Hunter
learning_goal: str       # e.g., "pan sauces"
```

**Process:**

**Step 1: Define Technique**
```python
# LLM prompt
"Define what the cooking technique 'pan sauces' actually means.
Provide: core method, key steps, distinguishing features."

# Example output
"A pan sauce is made by deglazing the fond (browned bits) left in a pan
after searing protein. The technique involves adding liquid to dissolve
the fond, then reducing and often finishing with butter/cream..."
```

**Step 2: Validate Each Recipe**
```python
# For each recipe
"Does this recipe genuinely teach 'pan sauces'?
Recipe: {title}
Steps: {first_3_steps}

Answer: YES or NO + reason"

# Example rejection
"NO - This is fried rice, which uses a pan but doesn't involve
deglazing or making a pan sauce."
```

**Output:**
```python
raw_recipes: List[Dict]  # Filtered subset (typically 40-60% kept)
```

**Observed Rejection Examples:**
- "Soy Sauce Fried Rice" → rejected for "pan sauces"
- "Creamy Mustard Sauce" → rejected for "pan sauces" (not made from fond)
- "Sourdough Bread" → rejected for "bread baking" (doesn't teach fundamentals)

**LLM Cost:** ~8 calls/request (1 definition + validation per recipe) = $0.0024/request

---

### Agent 4: Personalization Engine

**Responsibility:** Score recipes and select top 3 that teach complementary skills

**Input:**
```python
raw_recipes: List[Dict]  # Validated recipes
user: {
  "skill_level": str,
  "learning_goal": str,
  "dietary_restrictions": List[str]
}
```

**Process:**

**Step 1: Filtering**
- Dietary restrictions (keyword matching in ingredients)
- Skill appropriateness (beginner recipes for advanced users removed)

**Step 2: Scoring Algorithm**

```python
def score_recipe(recipe, user):
    score = 0

    # Learning value (30 points)
    # Count techniques relevant to learning goal
    relevant_techniques = recipe.techniques ∩ TECHNIQUE_MAP[user.learning_goal]
    score += len(relevant_techniques) * 10

    # Skill appropriateness (25 points)
    skill_match_table = {
        'beginner': {'beginner': 25, 'intermediate': 10, 'advanced': 0},
        'intermediate': {'beginner': 5, 'intermediate': 25, 'advanced': 15},
        'advanced': {'beginner': 0, 'intermediate': 10, 'advanced': 25}
    }
    score += skill_match_table[user.skill_level][recipe.difficulty]

    # Recency (20 points)
    if '2024' in recipe.published_date or '2025' in published_date:
        score += 20
    elif '2023' in published_date:
        score += 15

    # Tavily relevance (15 points)
    score += recipe.tavily_score * 15

    # Technique diversity bonus (10 points)
    if len(recipe.techniques) >= 3:
        score += 10

    return score  # Max 100 points
```

**Step 3: Selection with Diversity**
1. Sort by score descending
2. Select top recipe
3. For remaining slots, prefer recipes with unique techniques

**Step 4: Generate Educational Reasoning**

For each selected recipe, LLM generates:
```python
{
  "reasoning": "2-3 sentences explaining why this recipe fits learning goals",
  "technique_highlights": [
    "Specific skill 1 they'll practice",
    "Specific skill 2 they'll master",
    "Specific skill 3 they'll learn"
  ]
}
```

**Output:**
```python
final_cards = [
  {
    "recipe": {...},
    "reasoning": str,
    "technique_highlights": List[str],
    "score": float
  },
  # ... 2 more recipes
]
```

**LLM Cost:** 3 reasoning generations × 866 tokens = $0.0020/request

---

### Agent 5: Nutrition Analyzer

**Responsibility:** Estimate nutritional information for selected recipes

**Input:**
```python
final_cards: List[Dict]  # Top 3 recipes with full ingredient lists
```

**Process:**

1. **Find Full Recipe Data** - Match recipe title to retrieve complete ingredient list

2. **Estimate Servings** - Heuristic parsing:
   ```python
   # Search for patterns: "serves 4", "4 servings", "makes 6 portions"
   # Default to 4 servings if not found
   ```

3. **LLM Nutrition Estimation**
   ```python
   # Prompt
   "Estimate nutritional information PER SERVING:
   Recipe: {title}
   Servings: {estimated_servings}
   Ingredients: {ingredients}

   Return JSON:
   {
     'calories': int,
     'protein_g': int,
     'carbs_g': int,
     'fat_g': int,
     'fiber_g': int,
     'sodium_mg': int,
     'servings': int,
     'disclaimer': 'Estimated values - actual nutrition may vary'
   }"
   ```

**Output:**
```python
# Adds to each final_card
"nutrition": {
  "calories": 450,
  "protein_g": 25,
  "carbs_g": 35,
  "fat_g": 18,
  "fiber_g": 5,
  "sodium_mg": 600,
  "servings": 4,
  "disclaimer": "Estimated values - actual nutrition may vary"
}
```

**Note:** This is an LLM-based estimation, not database lookup. For production, integrate USDA FoodData Central API for accuracy.

**LLM Cost:** 3 estimations × 200 tokens = $0.0006/request

---

## Agent Coordination & Adaptive Behavior

### Conditional Routing: Retry Logic

**The Problem:** Initial search queries may be too specific and return insufficient results.

**The Solution:** Agent coordination through conditional routing.

```python
def route_after_recipe_hunter(state: RecipeState) -> str:
    """
    Decide whether to retry search or proceed to validation.

    This demonstrates true multi-agent coordination:
    - Agents observe each other's outputs
    - Adapt strategy based on results
    - Not a static pipeline
    """
    recipe_count = len(state['raw_recipes'])
    retry_count = state.get('retry_count', 0)

    if recipe_count < 3 and retry_count < 2:
        # Signal Research Planner to broaden search
        state['search_strategy'] = 'broadened'
        state['retry_count'] = retry_count + 1
        return "research_planner"  # Loop back

    return "technique_validator"  # Proceed forward
```

**Flow Diagram:**

```
Normal Path (Success):
Research Planner → Recipe Hunter (finds 9 recipes) → Technique Validator → ...

Adaptive Path (Retry):
Research Planner → Recipe Hunter (finds 2 recipes)
       ↑                          ↓
       └──── (broaden strategy) ───┘
Research Planner (broader) → Recipe Hunter (finds 7 recipes) → Technique Validator → ...
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Not a sequential pipeline
- Agents are autonomous decision-makers
- Coordination through shared state observation
- System adapts to edge cases (obscure techniques, advanced queries)

---

## State Management

### LangGraph State Schema

```python
class RecipeState(TypedDict):
    # User inputs
    learning_goal: str
    skill_level: str  # "beginner" | "intermediate" | "advanced"
    dietary_restrictions: List[str]

    # Agent outputs
    search_queries: List[str]           # Research Planner
    search_strategy: str                # Coordination signal
    raw_recipes: List[Dict[str, Any]]   # Recipe Hunter + Validator
    scored_recipes: List[Dict]          # Personalization
    final_cards: List[Dict]             # Personalization
    comparison: Optional[Dict]          # Personalization

    # Metadata
    errors: List[str]
    tavily_calls: int
    llm_calls: int
    retry_count: int
```

**State Flow:**
1. User input → Research Planner populates `search_queries`
2. Recipe Hunter populates `raw_recipes`, increments `tavily_calls`
3. Technique Validator filters `raw_recipes` in-place
4. Personalization populates `final_cards`, increments `llm_calls`
5. Nutrition adds `nutrition` to each card in `final_cards`

────────────────────────────────────────────
Total                 30,900    3 Tavily + 24 OpenAI
```

**Quality Metrics:**
- Recipes found: 9
- After validation: 4 (44% kept)
- Final selected: 3
- False positive rate: **0%** (validated)

---

## Error Handling

### Failure Scenarios

1. **No recipes found**
   - Trigger: Tavily returns 0 results
   - Response: HTTP 404 with suggestions to broaden search

2. **Validation filters all recipes**
   - Trigger: All recipes rejected by Technique Validator
   - Fallback: Return top-scored recipes with warning flag

3. **LLM parsing failures**
   - Trigger: Recipe text too short or malformed
   - Behavior: Skip recipe, continue with others

4. **API rate limits**
   - Tavily: Exponential backoff (not implemented in MVP)
   - OpenAI: Retry with 1s delay

---

## Security & Privacy

### API Key Management
- Environment variables via `.env` file
- Never committed to version control (`.gitignore`)
- Validated on startup (app fails fast if missing)

### Input Validation
- Skill level: Must be `beginner | intermediate | advanced`
- Learning goal: Max 100 characters
- Dietary restrictions: Predefined list

### Data Privacy
- No user data stored
- No request logging (stateless)
- Recipes fetched in real-time (no caching in MVP)

---

## Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations

1. **Single Source:** Only Serious Eats (MVP scope)
   - **Impact:** Limited recipe diversity
   - **Mitigation:** Expand to NYT Cooking, Bon Appétit, etc.

2. **Nutrition Estimation:** LLM-based, not database-backed
   - **Impact:** ±10-15% accuracy
   - **Mitigation:** Integrate USDA FoodData Central API

3. **No Caching:** Every request hits Tavily
   - **Impact:** High API costs for repeated queries
   - **Mitigation:** Redis cache with 24h TTL

4. **Synchronous Processing:** Blocks until completion
   - **Impact:** 30-45s user wait time
   - **Mitigation:** WebSocket for progress updates

### Planned Enhancements

**Phase 2 (Q1 2026):**
- Multi-source aggregation (5+ recipe sites)
- User accounts + recipe history
- Technique difficulty progression tracking

**Phase 3 (Q2 2026):**
- Video technique tutorials (YouTube API)
- Ingredient substitution suggestions
- Meal planning from saved recipes

---

## Deployment

### Local Development

```bash
